# Power-Bi
Power BI is a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft. It helps users visualize and analyze data, share insights, and make data-driven decisions. Power BI can connect to various data sources—like Excel, databases, online services, and more—and transform that data into interactive reports and dashboards.

# There are three main components to Power BI:

Power BI Desktop – A free, downloadable application where you can create and design reports and dashboards.
Power BI Service – An online platform for sharing, collaborating, and distributing reports and dashboards across teams and organizations.
Power BI Mobile – An app that allows users to access and interact with reports and dashboards on mobile devices.
