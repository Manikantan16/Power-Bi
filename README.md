# Power-Bi
Power BI is a business analytics tool developed by Microsoft. It helps users visualize and analyze data, share insights, and make data-driven decisions. Power BI can connect to various data sources‚Äîlike Excel, databases, online services, and more‚Äîand transform that data into interactive reports and dashboards.

### There are three main components to Power BI:

#### Power BI Desktop 
  - A free, downloadable application where you can create and design reports and dashboards.
#### Power BI Service 
  - An online platform for sharing, collaborating, and distributing reports and dashboards across teams and organizations.
#### Power BI Mobile 
  - An app that allows users to access and interact with reports and dashboards on mobile devices.
